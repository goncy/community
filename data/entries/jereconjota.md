bio: I am a backend developer from Comodoro Rivadavia, I am currently work remotely for Genosha. Since last month I have been really interested in NextJS.I believe it is important to know how to approach and resolve problems, then we can choose what technologies to use. That is why I try to learn a little bit more every day.
