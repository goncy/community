# Hi 👋, I'm Gabriel Alabí

### ➡️➡️➡️ Frontend 💻 Fullstack 🧑‍💻 developer 🧑
🔹 I'm a web developer with 2 years of programming learning. I studied on bootcamps, web courses and I self taught myself about web development, front and back end. I consider myself a frontend developer with backend knowledge 😅.

### ➡️➡️➡️ Looking for my first job as a programmer 👓
🔹 Active searching my first job on the IT field. I have experience on team work, customer support and having to organize work with schedules and responsabilities.

### ➡️➡️➡️ Always eager to learn, optimist, out-of-the-box
🔹 As person, and as a developer, i enjoy exploring, learning and having challenges. I dont give up easily, i always try to see things from diffrent perspectives so i can see the best results on what i need to do.

🔹 I love to know the rules on design and development so i can break them: if something can be done in someway that i feel i could improve i always try. When i know how to make something work i love to play with it so it can be better and stand out.
